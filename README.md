# CoC Bot Personal

A fully automated Clash of Clans bot that handles everything efficiently, including army training, spell management, and attacking. It is optimized to perform 10–15 attacks per hour during a training boost, with a 90% success rate. Attack failures usually occur only against higher-level Town Halls.

# Features

Fully automated: Manages training, army deployment, and attacks.

Optimized for Training Potions: Maximizes attacks during boost time.

High success rate: 90% of attacks secure at least one star.

Screen centering: The script automatically aligns the game screen for accurate execution.


# Army Composition

This setup is best for achieving 50% destruction or securing one star:

# ⚠️ Caution

Device Compatibility: The bot relies on cv2 (OpenCV) for image detection, which may not work correctly on different screen sizes or if UI scaling is changed.
